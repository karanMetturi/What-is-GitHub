# What-is-GitHub?

Lets first discuss about "Git"
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files

"GitHub" is a platform where we can practice git. 
A user can host a project where multiple other users can contribute to it using git. 
We can edit the source codes using sub-branches and finally committing the changes to the main branch whilst keeping track of the changes made which helps the host to keep track of the bugs/errors
